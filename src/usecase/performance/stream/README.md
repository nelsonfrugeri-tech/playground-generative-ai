# Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Responses with OpenAI's GPT-4

This document provides a conceptual overview and rationale for implementing both streaming and non-streaming API calls to OpenAI's GPT-4 using FastAPI. The code showcases the difference in handling long prompts and generating extended text outputs in a more efficient and responsive manner.

## Overview

The integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 model facilitates the generation of large-scale textual content based on provided prompts. Given the computational and temporal demands of generating extensive responses, optimizing the interaction with the model is crucial. The provided code illustrates two approaches:

- **Non-Streaming (Synchronous) Call:** Executes a single, blocking request to the model and waits for the complete response before proceeding.
- **Streaming (Asynchronous) Call:** Initiates a request to the model and processes the output in real-time as it becomes available, enhancing responsiveness and interactivity.

## Implementation

### Non-Streaming Approach

The non-streaming approach utilizes a synchronous API call to obtain a response from the GPT-4 model. This method waits for the entire content to be generated and received before any part of it is processed or returned to the client. It's implemented in the `main` endpoint.

```python
def chat_openai(prompt):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        stream=False,
        n=1
    )

    return response.choices[0].message.content

@app.get("/")
def main():
    return chat_openai(prompt)
```

### Streaming Approach

The streaming approach, in contrast, employs asynchronous processing, allowing the application to handle data incrementally as it's generated. This is particularly useful for long prompts where the model's output is extensive.

```python

async def chat_openai_stream(prompt):
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": instructions},
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
        ],
        stream=True,
        n=1
    )

    for chunk in stream:
        response = chunk.choices[0].delta.content        
        if response is not None:            
            yield response

@app.get("/stream")
async def main_stream():
    return StreamingResponse(chat_openai_stream(prompt), media_type="text/plain")
```

## Experiment Summary

The streaming approach using OpenAI's API has demonstrated significant advantages in user experience and response efficiency. By deploying the API with uvicorn and performing concurrent requests to the streaming and non-streaming endpoints, the experiment provided a clear comparison of how each method performs under identical conditions.

### Setup:
he API was launched using uvicorn api:app --reload. Requests were made simultaneously to http://localhost:8000/stream (streaming endpoint) and http://localhost:8000 (non-streaming endpoint) from separate terminals.

### Results:
- The streaming request began delivering content just 0.96 seconds after initiation, showcasing the ability to provide immediate feedback to the user.
- The non-streaming request took 11.34 seconds to return a response, with the total operation concluding in 19.39 seconds.

## Conclusions Drawn from the Test
- **Immediate Feedback**: The streaming approach significantly outperformed the non-streaming in terms of initial latency, delivering the first piece of content in under a second. This rapid feedback is crucial for user engagement, especially in interactive applications where waiting times can lead to user frustration.
- **Perceived Performance**: Even though the total time to receive the complete response was longer for the streaming method, the ability to see progress immediately greatly enhanced the perceived performance from the user's perspective.
- **User Experience**: The experiment underlines the importance of response time in user experience. Streaming provides a feeling of immediacy and progress, which is essential for maintaining user attention and satisfaction, especially in applications that require processing large amounts of data or generating extensive content.
- **Efficiency and Practicality**: While both approaches ultimately fulfill the request, streaming does so in a way that feels much quicker and more interactive. This can be particularly beneficial in real-world applications, where keeping the user informed about the process's progress can significantly impact the overall experience.

## Practical Implications
The results from this experiment have important implications for designing and deploying APIs, especially those involving large language models like GPT-4 for content generation. Streaming should be considered a preferred approach when the user experience is a priority, and the application demands responsive, real-time interactions.

In conclusion, streaming not only enhances the efficiency of data delivery but, more importantly, substantially improves the user experience by providing immediate, incremental feedback. This experiment vividly illustrates the advantages of streaming in real-world applications, emphasizing its value in user-centric application design and deployment.
