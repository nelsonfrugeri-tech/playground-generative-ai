    "### The code snippet bellow demonstrates the process of merging a base model with modifications (likely including LoRA weights) into a single consolidated model, followed by saving the merged model and configuring the associated tokenizer. This process is part of fine-tuning and optimizing models for specific tasks or improving their efficiency. Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Loading the Base Model:** The AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained method is used to load a pre-existing base model identified by model_id. Several parameters are specified for efficient loading and operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- low_cpu_mem_usage=True: Reduces CPU memory usage by loading model weights on demand rather than all at once. This is beneficial for systems with limited memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- return_dict=True: Ensures that the model outputs are returned as a dictionary, providing easier access to different components of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- torch_dtype=torch.float16: Sets the data type of the model tensors to float16, reducing memory usage and potentially increasing computation speed on compatible hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- device_map={\"\": 0}: Maps the model to a specific device, in this case, GPU 0. This ensures that the model utilizes GPU acceleration if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Merging the Model with LoRA Weights:** PeftModel.from_pretrained is called with the base model and the path or identifier of the new model (new_model) containing LoRA or other parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) weights. This step creates an instance of PeftModel that includes both the base model and the modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- merged_model.merge_and_unload(): This method finalizes the merging process of the base model with the additional weights or modifications and prepares the merged_model for use or saving by unloading any temporary resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Saving the Merged Model:** The save_pretrained method saves the merged_model to a directory named \"merged_model\". The safe_serialization=True parameter ensures that the model is saved in a way that minimizes risks during the saving process, potentially by using more robust serialization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Configuring and Saving the Tokenizer:** The tokenizer associated with the model is also saved in the \"merged_model\" directory. Before saving, the tokenizer's padding token is set to be the same as its end-of-sequence (EOS) token, and the padding is configured to be applied from the \"right\" side. These tokenizer settings are crucial for ensuring consistent text processing, especially for models trained on specific tokenization and padding schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is crucial for deploying models that have been fine-tuned with advanced techniques like LoRA, ensuring that all modifications are properly integrated with the base model and that the model is ready for inference or further training. Saving the model and tokenizer in this way facilitates easy sharing and reuse."

    "5) **Model Inference:** The tokenized input is moved to the GPU (encodeds.to(device)) and passed to the model. The generate method is called with parameters controlling the generation process: max_new_tokens specifies the maximum length of the generated sequence, do_sample=True enables stochastic generation for varied outputs, and pad_token_id is set to ensure proper sequence termination.\n",
